## How These Were Used

### Reality Check Phase
- Validated that all technical claims were grounded in proven technology
- Ensured performance targets were conservative and achievable
- Verified architectural decisions against production precedents

### Production Readiness Revisions
- Applied MVP-first methodology
- Established realistic timelines for solo developer
- Clarified distinction between design and implementation
- Set appropriate scope for learning project

### Validation
- Confirmed all features have production precedents
- Validated feasibility of incremental implementation
- Ensured consistency across all documentation

## Key Principles Applied

1. **MVP First** - Prove core concept before expanding
2. **Unit Testing** - Catch bugs early in development
3. **Incremental Development** - Build in phases with clear milestones
4. **Realistic Scope** - Solo developer timeline (7+ years)
5. **Proven Foundations** - Build on established technology (LLVM, Rust patterns, L4 research)
