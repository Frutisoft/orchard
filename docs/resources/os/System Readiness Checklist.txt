System Readiness Checklist
A System Readiness Checklist is a pre-launch tool used to ensure that a system is properly configured and ready for use. It covers all the steps necessary to ensure that the system has been tested, is ready to go into production, and can perform its intended functions. The checklist typically includes items such as verifying that the system meets security requirements, backup is ready, data is properly loaded, and user permissions are set. The System Readiness Checklist serves as a final check to make sure that a system is configured correctly and is ready to go live.
