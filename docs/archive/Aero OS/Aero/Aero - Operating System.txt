Aero OS: The Next-Generation Operating System
Frutisoft's vision for an operating system that reimagines how users and developers interact with computing—built from the ground up in Fruti for maximum performance, security, and usability.
________________


1. Core Vision

Aero OS is not just another Unix clone or Windows alternative. It's a fundamental rethinking of what an operating system should be in the modern era:

**For Users:**
- Instant boot (< 2 seconds to desktop)
- Zero configuration needed
- Self-healing and auto-updating
- Complete privacy by default
- Beautiful, consistent interface
- Works offline-first

**For Developers:**
- Native Fruti development environment
- System APIs that make sense
- Real-time performance profiling built-in
- Containers without Docker
- Web and native apps use the same APIs
- Zero-downtime updates

**For Everyone:**
- Runs on anything (ARM, x86, RISC-V)
- Full compatibility with existing software
- Energy-efficient (2x battery life vs traditional OS)
- Secure by architecture, not by patching
- Open source with commercial support

2. Technical Architecture

2.1 Microkernel Design
Unlike monolithic kernels (Linux, Windows) or hybrid kernels (macOS), Aero uses a pure microkernel:

```
User Space:
├── Applications
├── System Services
├── Device Drivers
└── File Systems

Microkernel (< 50,000 lines):
├── Process Management
├── Memory Management  
├── IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
├── Basic Scheduling
└── Hardware Abstraction
```

**Benefits:**
- Driver crashes don't crash the system
- Update drivers without rebooting
- Formal verification possible for kernel
- Better security isolation
- Truly modular architecture

2.2 Memory Management
```
// Aero memory model
Virtual Address Space:
├── User Space (0x0000_0000 - 0x7FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF)
│   ├── Program Code
│   ├── Heap (managed by Fruti runtime)
│   ├── Stack (auto-growing)
│   └── Memory-mapped files
└── Kernel Space (0x8000_0000_0000_0000 - 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF)
    ├── Kernel Code
    ├── Kernel Heap
    └── Device Memory
```

**Features:**
- No swap by default (compression instead)
- Memory deduplication for reduced RAM usage
- NUMA-aware allocation
- Huge page support automatic
- Memory encrypted by default (security)

2.3 Process Model
```
Process:
├── Capabilities (fine-grained permissions)
├── Virtual Memory Space
├── File Descriptors
├── Network Sockets
├── IPC Channels
└── Threads
    ├── CPU Affinity
    ├── Priority
    └── Stack
```

**Innovation:**
- Capability-based security (no root user!)
- Process can only access explicitly granted resources
- Sandboxing built into every process
- Parent process controls child permissions
- No privilege escalation exploits possible

2.4 File System: AeroFS
```
AeroFS Features:
├── Copy-on-write (like ZFS/btrfs)
├── Built-in compression (transparent)
├── Snapshots (instant, zero-cost)
├── Checksums for data integrity
├── Self-healing (auto-repair corruption)
├── Online defragmentation
└── Encryption (per-file or full-disk)

Directory Structure:
/
├── apps/          # Installed applications
├── system/        # OS files
├── users/         # User home directories
├── data/          # Shared data
├── dev/           # Device files
└── config/        # System configuration
```

**No more scattered config files!**
- All config in `/config` (not `/etc`, `/usr/share`, etc.)
- Human-readable TOML format
- Versioned changes (rollback any config)
- Live reload without restarts

2.5 Scheduler
```
Aero Scheduler:
├── Real-time threads (FIFO/Round-Robin)
├── Interactive threads (low latency)
├── Batch processing (throughput)
└── Idle (power saving)

Algorithm: BFS (Brain-Friendly Scheduler)
- Latency-focused for desktop responsiveness
- Topology-aware (NUMA, SMT)
- Automatic CPU affinity
- Power-aware (P-states, C-states)
```

**Results:**
- 60 FPS GUI even under heavy load
- Audio never stutters
- Video playback always smooth
- Background tasks don't slow foreground
________________


3. Security Model

3.1 Capability-Based Security
```
Traditional OS (e.g., Linux):
User -> Groups -> Permissions on files
Problem: Any process as user has ALL user permissions

Aero OS:
Process -> Explicit Capabilities
Each process only has capabilities granted at launch

Example:
Text editor launched by user:
✓ Read/write specific file being edited
✓ Access clipboard
✗ Network access
✗ Access to other files
✗ Camera/microphone
```

3.2 Sandboxing by Default
```
Application Container:
├── Allowed capabilities
├── File system view (only what's needed)
├── Network policy (if any)
├── Resource limits (CPU, RAM, disk)
└── IPC channels (explicitly granted)

// Fruti code to launch sandboxed app
let app = Process::spawn("text-editor")
    .capability(Capability::ReadFile(path))
    .capability(Capability::WriteFile(path))
    .capability(Capability::Clipboard)
    .resource_limit(Memory::megabytes(500))
    .start()?
```

3.3 No More Malware
Traditional malware vectors blocked:
- ❌ DLL injection - not possible (no shared libraries in process space)
- ❌ Registry manipulation - no registry
- ❌ Startup items - capability required
- ❌ Keylogging - no global keyboard access
- ❌ Screen capture - explicit permission required
- ❌ Network backdoors - network capability required

3.4 Verified Boot
```
Boot Chain:
1. CPU firmware (immutable)
2. Bootloader (signed, verified)
3. Kernel (signed, verified, measured)
4. System services (signed, verified)
5. Applications (optional signing)

Each step cryptographically verifies the next
Compromise detected = boot fails safely
```

4. User Interface: Aero Desktop

4.1 Design Principles
- **Beautiful by default**: No configuration needed to look good
- **Consistent**: Every app follows same patterns
- **Fast**: 60 FPS animations, instant response
- **Adaptive**: Dark/light mode, accessibility built-in
- **Productive**: Keyboard-first, but touch-friendly

4.2 Visual Themes
```
Built-in Themes:
├── Aero Light (default) - Modern, clean
├── Aero Dark - Easy on eyes
├── Metro Light/Dark - Flat, minimalist
├── Cyber Light/Dark - Futuristic, high contrast
├── Corporate Light/Dark - Professional
├── Eco Light/Dark - Nature-inspired, warm
├── Aurora Light/Dark - Vibrant, colorful
└── Vectorflourish Light/Dark - Artistic, expressive

Each theme:
- Light and dark variants
- High contrast accessibility mode
- Colorblind-friendly options
- Custom accent colors
```

4.3 Window Management
```
Window Operations:
├── Tiling (automatic, configurable)
├── Stacking (traditional windows)
├── Tabbing (like browser tabs)
├── Fullscreen
└── Picture-in-picture

Keyboard Shortcuts (intuitive):
Super + Arrow keys -> Tile windows
Super + Tab -> Switch apps
Super + Space -> Command palette
Super + / -> Search everything
```

4.4 Desktop Features
- **Universal search**: Find files, apps, settings, commands instantly
- **Clipboard history**: Never lose copied text again
- **Virtual desktops**: Organize work contexts
- **Notification center**: All notifications in one place, not distracting
- **Quick settings**: Volume, brightness, WiFi, Bluetooth one click away
- **Activity monitor**: See what's using resources in real-time

5. Application Model

5.1 Universal Apps (Not "Native" vs "Web")
```
Aero Application:
├── Fruti code (logic)
├── Declarative UI (Aero.UI framework)
├── Permissions manifest
└── Resources (icons, assets)

Runs:
✓ Native desktop (optimal performance)
✓ Web browser (via WASM compilation)
✓ Mobile (iOS, Android via Aero runtime)
✓ Server (headless mode)

ONE codebase, EVERYWHERE
```

5.2 Aero.UI Framework
```
import aero.ui

fn main() {
    Window::new()
        .title("Hello Aero")
        .content(
            VStack([
                Text("Hello, World!")
                    .font_size(24),
                Button("Click Me")
                    .on_click(fn { 
                        println("Clicked!") 
                    })
            ])
        )
        .show()
}
```

**Features:**
- Declarative (like SwiftUI, Flutter)
- Reactive (state changes auto-update UI)
- Hardware accelerated (GPU rendering)
- Accessible by default (screen readers, keyboard nav)
- Themable (respects system theme)

5.3 Package Manager: `aero pkg`
```
# Install application
aero pkg install firefox
aero pkg install vscode

# Update all applications
aero pkg update

# Remove application
aero pkg remove firefox

# Search applications
aero pkg search editor

# Install from source
aero pkg install github.com/user/project
```

**Features:**
- Dependency resolution automatic
- Sandboxed installations
- Delta updates (only changed files)
- Rollback any update
- No administrator required

6. Developer Experience

6.1 System APIs (Fruti)
```
import aero.system

// File I/O
let file = File::open("document.txt")?
let content = file.read_all()?

// Networking
let response = http::get("https://api.example.com").await?

// Processes
let output = Process::run("command", ["arg1", "arg2"]).await?

// IPC
let channel = IPC::channel("service-name")
channel.send(Message { data: "hello" })?

// System info
let cpu_count = System::cpu_count()
let memory_total = System::memory_total()

// Notifications
Notification::new()
    .title("Task Complete")
    .body("Your file has been processed")
    .show()
```

6.2 Driver Development
```
import aero.driver

@driver
struct MyDriver {
    device: Device
}

impl MyDriver {
    fn init(device: Device) -> Result<Self> {
        // Initialize hardware
        Ok(MyDriver { device })
    }
    
    fn read(self, offset: u64, buffer: mut [u8]) -> Result<usize> {
        // Read from device
    }
    
    fn write(self, offset: u64, data: [u8]) -> Result<usize> {
        // Write to device
    }
}
```

**No more C drivers!**
- Type-safe, memory-safe
