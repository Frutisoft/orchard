# Archive

This directory contains historical documentation files that were created during the initial project design phase.

## Contents

- **Aero OS/** - Original Aero OS documentation
  - `Aero - Operating System.txt` - Initial OS design notes

- **Frutilang/** - Original Fruti language documentation
  - `Fruti - Programming Language.txt` - Initial language specification
  - `Fruti - Programming Examples.txt` - Early code examples

## Why Archived?

These files have been superseded by the comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory. The new documentation is:

- **More organized** - Modular structure for easy navigation
- **More complete** - Resolved all design ambiguities
- **Better formatted** - Professional Markdown with examples
- **GitHub-ready** - Prepared for open source collaboration

## Migration

All content from these original files has been:

- Expanded with proper technical specifications
- Organized into dedicated sections (Reference, Guides, Examples)
- Enhanced with implementation status and roadmaps
- Integrated with the compiler codebase

## Historical Context

These documents represent the initial brainstorming and specification phase completed in early 2025. They served as the foundation for:

1. **Fruti Compiler Phase 1 MVP** - Completed December 7, 2025
2. **Comprehensive Language Documentation** - Reference, guides, and examples
3. **Aero OS Technical Specification** - Architecture and implementation plans
4. **Monorepo Structure** - Organization of the Frutisoft ecosystem

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date information, see:

- `/docs/fruti/` - Complete Fruti language documentation
- `/docs/aero/` - Aero OS specifications and guides
- `/docs/project/` - Project management and timelines
- `/README.md` - Main repository overview

## Preservation Purpose

We preserve these files as a record of:

- The original project vision
- Early design decisions and iterations
- Evolution from concept to implementation
- Historical reference for future contributors
